# Calculation of seniority

* Calcule weeks, years, month and days.
* Calculate years elapsed between two dates.
* Calculate months elapsed between two dates.
* To calculate the number of weeks between two dates we will start from the number of days we previously calculated taking this value we divide it between 7.

# Example:

fecha_desde = '2015-12-25'<br>
fecha_hasta = '2017-06-02'

data = calc_weeks(fecha_desde, fecha_hasta)

data = calc_days(fecha_desde, fecha_hasta)
